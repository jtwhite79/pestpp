/* A conditional-independence graph over the adjustable parameters, and the
sparse prior precision estimated on it.

This is the input mode the ensemble information filter is actually built around:
rather than supplying a p x p prior covariance - which does not scale - the user
supplies the SPARSITY PATTERN of the prior precision and the precision itself is
estimated from the prior ensemble.  A dense covariance generally has a nearly
sparse inverse, which is the whole premise.

The graph is read with Mat::from_file(), so it comes for free in every matrix
format pest++ already understands:

    .jcb / .jco   binary; the extended/coo variant is genuine (i,j,value) triplet
                  storage with long names, so it stays sparse on disk
    .mat / .cov   ascii PEST matrix format
    .csv          comma separated

Any structural non-zero is an edge; the value is ignored.  The matrix is
symmetrised (G union G^T) and the diagonal forced on, so a thresholded
correlation matrix, a localiser product, or a hand-built adjacency all mean the
same thing.

Note on how the precision is USED: H^T R^-1 H is dense unless H is also sparse,
so forming the posterior precision explicitly would throw the sparsity away.
Instead the solve keeps the woodbury form and obtains C*H^T by sparse-solving
Lam * X = H^T for the n observation right-hand sides.  No p x p dense matrix is
ever formed and no sparsity is required of H.

/* Estimate a SPARSE observation operator H (n x p) by lasso regression of the
observation anomalies on the parameter anomalies, one independent problem per
observation row.

Sparsity here is load-bearing, not cosmetic.  A structural zero in H is the
statement "this observation carries no information about this parameter", which
is what makes H an inspectable influence map.  It is also what keeps
H^T Rinv H - and therefore the posterior precision - sparse, so the graph is
worth having at all.

lasso_frac scales the penalty relative to the smallest value that would zero a
whole row, so it is dimensionless and lives in (0,1).  unexplained returns the
per-observation residual variance, which is the quantity the observation error is
inflated by.  Rows are independent, so this parallelises over num_threads.

cv_folds > 0 switches to the way the reference implementation fits H: every
parameter and observation anomaly row is scaled to unit length first, and the
penalty for each observation is picked by cv_folds-fold cross-validation over the
realizations, along a path of penalties with warm starts, then refit on all of
them.  lasso_frac is not used then.  on raw anomalies a fixed penalty lets
parameters whose spread has collapsed in, and H ends up interpolating the
ensemble, which leaves the unexplained-variance inflation with nothing to do.

unexp_divisor is what the raw residual sum of squares is divided by to get the
unexplained variance.  the default (anything <= 0) is the number of columns,
which is what the mean-centred fit wants.  the realization-centred fit passes
the number of columns that actually carry a deviation (its centre column is
identically zero), or the weight sum when the columns are weighted.

frec is any ostream, so threads can each write to their own stringstream. */
